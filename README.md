# C++ labs

Here one can find my work for some labs during the first year at Higher School of Economics. 

Solutions are written on C++. 

- [`lab01-executor`](https://github.com/de-shyt/cplusplus_labs/blob/main/lab01-executor/README.md)

  This task consists of 2 parts:

  - **Quote book**. Commands `sherlock-holmes` and `cat-jeoffry` show fragments from Sherlock Holmes and Jubilate Agno respectively. Command `quit` exits the interpreter. Commands can have pseudonyms.
  - **Wanderer**. A wanderer walks on the infinite plane. Commands allow to move forward and backward; turn around on 90 degrees to the left and to the right; show the map. Also, reconding of a sequnce of commands is supported. The recorded sequence can be executed later.

- [`lab02-bigint`](https://github.com/de-shyt/cplusplus_labs/tree/main/lab02-bigint)

  The task is to create a structure `bigint` that saves a number of a random length and supports basic operations. Only positive numbers are supported.

- [`lab05-tic-tac-toe`](https://github.com/de-shyt/cplusplus_labs/tree/main/lab05-tic-tac-toe)

  A console game *tic-tac-toe* on a filed 10Ã—10. The are two possible views of the field:  `view-compact` and `view-pretty`. The view of the field can be changed during the game session.

- [`lab07-interpreter`](https://github.com/de-shyt/cplusplus_labs/tree/main/lab07-interpreter)

  An interpreter for an assembler-like programming language. There are ten registers from $0$ to $9$. Each register saves a matrix of a random size with integers. There are commands to manipulate data stored in registers.
